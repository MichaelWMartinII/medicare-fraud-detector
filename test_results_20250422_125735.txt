GPT Summary of Isolation Forest Evaluation:
- The model correctly identified 97% of normal (non-fraudulent) Medicare claims. This means it is very good at recognizing legitimate claims.
- However, the model only correctly identified 53% of fraudulent claims, and only flagged 16% of the actual fraudulent cases. This means it is not very effective at catching fraud.
- Overall, the model was accurate for 97% of the total claims it processed. This high accuracy is largely due to the model's ability to correctly identify normal claims, which are much more common than fraudulent ones.
